### Background Information

The rapid digital revolution requires a corresponding skills revolution. It’s no longer just about digital expertise; it’s about fostering digital awareness, emotional intelligence, and creativity to prepare for the future workplace. At PwC, we are committed to upskilling our 276,000 people, working alongside organizations worldwide to ensure everyone can participate in the digital world.

As part of this initiative, we are empowering individuals to become **Digital Accelerators**, with the ability to dive deep into digital specialties like data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling. The aim is to equip them with tools and coding languages to drive business transformation.

In this job simulation, I was tasked with creating a **Power BI dashboard** to provide critical insights for a leading telecom company. Claire, our client, needed to understand what their customers truly want and how their operations are performing. The dashboard I created visualizes relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to give the company a clear view of their performance and help guide data-driven decision-making.

### Task 1 - Call Centre Trends

#### Task Overview

Claire's request focused on creating a dashboard that reflects important KPIs, such as:
- **Overall Customer Satisfaction**
- **Call Metrics:** Answered and abandoned calls, call times, average speed of answer
- **Agent Performance:** Average handle time vs. calls answered, agent performance quadrant

#### Dataset Used 

The primary dataset used for this analysis is "[Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16919065/01.Call-Center-Dataset.1.xlsx)".

#### Tools Used


- **Power BI:** For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
