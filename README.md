# Forage-PwC-Power-BI-Job-Simulation

## Overview
This repository showcases my work during the **PwC Power BI Job Simulation**, where I tackled key business challenges for a telecom client through data-driven storytelling. Each task is designed to provide actionable insights, leveraging data visualization and analysis to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively.

My approach throughout this project emphasized attention to detail, problem-solving, and creativity, while crafting narratives that guide decision-making.

### Background Information

The rapid digital revolution requires a corresponding skills revolution. It’s no longer just about digital expertise; it’s about fostering digital awareness, emotional intelligence, and creativity to prepare for the future workplace. At PwC, we are committed to upskilling our 276,000 people, working alongside organizations worldwide to ensure everyone can participate in the digital world.

As part of this initiative, we are empowering individuals to become **Digital Accelerators**, with the ability to dive deep into digital specialties like data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling. The aim is to equip them with tools and coding languages to drive business transformation.

In this job simulation, I was tasked with creating a **Power BI dashboard** to provide critical insights for a leading telecom company. Claire, our client, needed to understand what their customers truly want and how their operations are performing. The dashboard I created visualizes relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to give the company a clear view of their performance and help guide data-driven decision-making.

### Project Tasks

#### 1. Customer Service Dashboard

#### Objective

Create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) for customer service, enabling the telecom company to monitor performance and identify areas for improvement.

#### Key Insights
- **Agent Performance:** Identified areas of inefficiency by tracking average handle times and calls answered per agent.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Provided a clear view of customer satisfaction rates over time, pinpointing where improvements in service could enhance overall experience.
- **Call Metrics:** Visualized overall calls answered and abandoned, along with the average speed of answer, enabling better management of resources during peak periods.

#### Data Story
By analyzing customer service operations, this dashboard highlights areas of strength and opportunities for improvement, offering a clear narrative on how the telecom company can optimize its service.

#### 2. Customer Retention Dashboard

#### Objective
Develop a retention-focused dashboard to identify at-risk customers and offer proactive strategies to reduce churn.

#### Key Insights

- **Churn Prediction:** Established a clear view of churn rates and customer engagement levels, identifying patterns that signal potential risk.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Visualized CLV to focus retention efforts on high-value customers.
- **Proactive Retention:** Recommended a shift from reactive strategies to proactive engagement with customers before contract termination.

#### Data Story
This dashboard tells the story of customer retention through predictive insights. By uncovering key trends, it equips the retention team with the information needed to intervene early and retain valuable customers.

#### 3. Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard

#### Objective
Create a dashboard that analyzes gender balance at the executive level, offering insights into hiring, promotions, and turnover to improve diversity and inclusion efforts.

#### Key Insights
- **Gender Representation:** Visualized the current gender distribution at various management levels, identifying disparities.
- **Promotion and Turnover Rates:** Highlighted the discrepancies in promotion rates and turnover by gender, pointing to potential areas of unconscious bias.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Provided an analytical narrative on why progress in gender diversity has been slow, suggesting strategies to improve leadership development and retention of female executives.

#### Data Story
This dashboard uncovers the factors contributing to slow progress in diversity at the executive level. It offers a clear, data-driven narrative that helps the telecom client take actionable steps toward building a more inclusive leadership team.

#### Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI:** For data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Excel:** For data cleaning and initial analysis.
- **Data Storytelling:** Crafting a narrative around business insights through visualizations.

### Repository Structure
Each task in this project has been organized into its own folder for easy navigation. Inside each folder, you'll find the corresponding Power BI dashboard along with relevant file.

- **Task 1 - Customer Service Dashboard:** Located in the `Task_1_Customer_Service_Dashboard` folder. This folder contains the Power BI file.

- **Task 2 - Customer Retention Dashboard:** The retention-focused dashboard can be found in the `Task_2_Customer_Retention_Dashboard` folder.

- **Task 3 - Diversity and Inclusion Dashboard:** The final task's diversity dashboard is located in the `Task_3_Diversity_and_Inclusion_Dashboard` folder, including visualizations.

Each folder provides the Power BI file (**.pbix**).

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to combine **data analysis**, **visual storytelling**, and **strategic insights to solve real business challenges**. By focusing on key performance metrics and uncovering trends through detailed analysis, I delivered solutions that are easy for stakeholders to understand and act upon.

The dashboards in this repository reflect a deep attention to detail and a creative approach to data storytelling. Each visualization tells a unique story, aimed at driving business decisions and improving operations.
